It was the decade that saw the fall of Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War — not to mention the rise of designer jeans, tube socks and hot pants. These and many other new and exciting developments in technology, fashion and popular culture defined the character of the baby boomer generation. The rollercoaster that was the 1970s brought some new vocabulary to the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> English</a> language to match its new cultural landscape.&nbsp;For those of us who didn’t experience those turbulent times, here are some of the key 70s slang words and phrases that define the decade just as much as Queen, the Bee Gees and Blondie.&nbsp;</p><li><a href=#>Boogie</a></li><li><a href=#>Stick it to the Man</a></li><li><a href=#>10-4</a></li><li><a href=#>Keep on truckin’</a></li><li><a href=#>Cool beans</a></li><li><a href=#>Space cadet</a></li><li><a href=#>Peace out</a></li><li><a href=#>Catch you on the flip side</a></li><li><a href=#>Square</a></li><li><a href=#>Groovy</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Boogie>1. Boogie</h2><p>The word “boogie” has its roots well before the 1970s, in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boogie-woogie</a> blues music of the late 1920s. It was in the 70s, though, that the word took on its modern connotation: to get up and dance to disco music. That makes it one of the most popular disco slang words of the 70s.</p><p>“The old Wild Cat Club was a great place to boogie on a Saturday night.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Stick-it-to-the-Man>2. Stick it to the Man</h2><p>From the end of the 1960s into the 1970s, young people used this phrase to describe an act of defiance or resistance against “the Man.” Who is the Man precisely? Any source or system of oppression, be that capitalism, patriarchy, the government, globalization, your parents, whoever — it doesn’t matter. Stick it to them.</p><p>“I can’t believe you told your boss to go to hell. Way to stick it to the Man!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-10-4>3. 10-4</h2><p>This one has its roots in police <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">radio codes</a> in the 1930s, where it was used to signal that a message was understood loud and clear. Its meaning is similar to the phrase, “roger that”. It was then adopted by truckers communicating over short-range, citizens’ Band (CB) radio, and finally went mainstream in 1975 with C. W. McCall’s song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Convoy”</a>.</p><p>“Hey Mike, we’re meeting at 8 over at Frankie’s.”</p><p>“10-4 good buddy.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Keep-on-truckin’>4. Keep on truckin’</h2><p>Another trucker reference. To “keep on truckin’” is to persevere through a difficult task or challenge with resilience.</p><p>“Times are tough, but all you can do is keep on truckin’.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Cool-beans>5. Cool beans</h2><p>Prior to its brief resurgence in the late 2000s, “cool beans” was a popular catchphrase on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">college campuses</a> in the late 1960s and 1970s, meaning great, splendid or awesome. Although there are a few theories, there is no agreement on the roots of this peculiar phrase.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dude, I aced my exam.”</p><p>“Cool beans.”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Space-cadet>6. Space cadet</h2><p>Someone who tends to space out, an eccentric daydreamer (or perhaps someone high enough to visit the International Space Station).</p><p>“Hey, Hannah, pay attention. You’re a real space cadet today.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Peace-out>7. Peace out</h2><p>This love and peace era expression was used to send good, positive vibes on taking leave of your friends. It is most effectively delivered while you pound your chest twice with your fist, then throw a two-finger peace sign.</p><p>“I’ll catch you later, peace out.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Catch-you-on-the-flip-side>8. Catch you on the flip side</h2><p>See you later. The “flip side” refers to the reverse side of a vinyl record. Radio Disc Jockeys or DJs (another recently popularized term) began the use of this phrase to imply that they would play a record through before they continued talking, but the phrase soon entered popular usage as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">casual farewell to friends</a>.</p><p>“Gotta go, dude. I’ll catch you on the flip side.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Square>9. Square</h2><p>A person who was not “with it” — in other words, someone who was boring, unadventurous, conformist or otherwise uncool.&nbsp;</p><p>“You won’t see him at the party. He’s too much of a square.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Groovy>10. Groovy</h2><p>Used to describe something that is cool, fashionable, fun or hip. The word first emerged in the 1920s African-American jazz scene, but its use peaked in the 70s, when it was ubiquitous in popular music, movies, television and advertising. As with many voguish slang words though, once it reached this level of overuse, it quickly became uncool and largely fell out of popular favor towards the end of the decade and into the 1980s, when it became increasingly used in satire on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American popular culture</a>.</p><p>“The bar is a bit rundown but they always play such groovy music.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Groovy times</h2><p>Although some of these funny sayings from the 70s might make you cringe, just remember that it will only be a matter of time before our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">own favorite slang terms</a> will be the subject of jokes and satire. And who knows, maybe these phrases will make a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comeback</a>. So you’ll be glad to know the old lingo. Until then, catch you on the flip side.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Leona-e1679309439969.jpeg><h2>Leona Quigley</h2><p>Leona has her roots in the South of Ireland, where she grew up on her family farm.
