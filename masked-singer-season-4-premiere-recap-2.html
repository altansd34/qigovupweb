Plus, the guessing game is on again. And we got to see some of the best performances in the history of the show! We were promised bigger and better singers and they definitely delivered with Group A.</strong></p><p>It all happened on The Masked Singer season 4 premiere, and here’s our full recap. You won’t want to miss it!</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who is The Sun?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoL_Y4he4tA</p>The Sun performs “Cuz I Love You” by Lizzo on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: The first clues for the Sun start with her welcoming us to her “solar sanctuary.” She holds up a card that says “FUN DIRECTOR GOLD MEMBER.” She says she’s had some “extreme seasons in [her] life.” When the Sun first “sprung into existence,” she felt like the center of the universe. But the spotlight burned her out, she says as a Mickey Mouse outline is shown. She describes going into a deep depression, saying she was “frozen.” But she transformed into a “ray of light.” We see a big cat, like a cheetah or jaguar, next to the pool in the last shot of her clues.</p><p>When asked how’s it being the Sun, she said she feels like it’s a “reflection of who I am personally.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Right from the get-go, you can tell the Sun has some vocal POWER! She nails all the high notes on Lizzo’s “Cuz I Love You” and even has the swag for the more spoken verses. The Sun really brings it home in the chorus, holding a crazy high note and proving she’s a force to be reckoned with. I think we’ll be seeing her around for a while! Is it possible we’ve already seen this season’s winner one performance in?</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: In a plot twist, all the panelists will be competing this season too! The judge who guesses the most correct will win the coveted “Golden Ear Trophy.” Nicole guessed Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, or Katharine McPhee. Jenny thought it was Demi Lovato. Ken predicted Madonna but the other judges disagreed.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who is The Giraffe?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-4zAhPqqKw</p>The Giraffe performs “Let’s Get It Started” by The Black Eyed Peas on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: The Giraffe’s clues were all carnival-themed. He says he’s had a “roller coaster career, full of ups and downs.” Music is “in his blood,” but when he took a step out, he became the butt of everyone’s jokes. He’s seen getting apples and tomatoes thrown at him. The Giraffe was “in knots and felt so lonely, like the party was over.” But that got him to swing even higher, he says as he uses a hammer to play a carnival game. There’s also a sign with “$3” printed on it. With hard work, he found “towering success.”</p><p>When asked if he ever though he would be on stage singing as a Giraffe, he says no. Then, he explains “it’s really been fun, plus it was a big deal to not have to focus on vocals.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: In an orchestrated version of “Let’s Get It Started” by The Black Eyes Peas, the Giraffe raps pretty perfectly to be honest. He does a great job and has a ton of energy, so it’s fun to watch. Even the panelists are on their feet dancing along.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Ken thought it might be Garth Brooks, acting as his rapping alter-ego. Jenny guessed Travis Barker, then Robin predicted Vanilla Ice.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who is The Popcorn?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOisRcd61Lk</p>Popcorn performs “What About Us” by P!nk on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Popcorn’s clues start with a “Snacks and the City” title. She makes a Tiger King reference in the intro, then she’s laying in bed next to a tiger. We also see a goldfish wearing hoop earrings in the background. She’s “straight up” “built her career around love,” but she’s a “hustler.” Popcorn has worked long nights, rushing from one job to the next. A meatloaf with a “Welcome to the ‘hood!” card is displayed on a table next to a snake and an apple. She went from cutting pictures out of Vogue, to jet-setting to exotic places with royalty. A magazine cover depicts her on a plane with a king and a dove with an olive branch. On the side of a bus, it says “Every Wednesday in The Broadway Review.” Finally, we see a “Proud Merry-Go-Round.”</p><p>Popcorn chose this costume because “like popcorn, she can be very buttery, salty, and sometimes sweet.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Popcorn crushed this performance of “What About Us” by P!nk. And this song is covered a lot so we’ve heard it plenty of times! It’s not easy to sing either. She clearly has a particular tone and is an older woman from her voice.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Jenny said it could be Tina Turner. Ken guessed Carole Baskin from Tiger King! And finally, Nicole thought it might be Mary J Blige.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who is The Dragon?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LArwic6Hx8M</p>The Dragon performs “Mama Said Knock You Out” by LL Cool J on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: To start the Dragon’s clues, he introduces us to his “lair,” which has three cars parked outside. He says “dressing up in funky, outrageous costumes isn’t new to me.” Like a dragon, he’s always been a “beast on the quest to be the best.” But at first, his fire was “dangerous.” He blows a flame that turns into a tornado. Then, he says he got a tip to calm down and is seen in a bath surrounded by candles. He opens the door to a room full of trophies and a dumbbell.</p><p>He says being the Dragon has been “an incredible experience” for him.</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Rapping “Mama Said Knock You Out” by LL Cool J, this voice is one-of-a-kind. He has a low rasp and hits everything in rhythm. The Dragon isn’t new to this! He lights up the stage too, with pyrotechnics and fun graphics behind him.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Jenny predicted it was Snoop Dogg or DMX. Ken guessed Michael Phelps. Lastly, Robin thought it was Busta Rhymes, which Nicole agreed with.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who Are The Snow Owls?</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnz_8PILV8</p>The Snow Owls perform “Say Something” by A Great Big World on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Our first ever duo! Their clues take place in “JAM-A-LOT.” They say “you haven’t seen us together in a while,” as they fly over to a couch with a clam and pearl on a table next to them. Now, “it’s time for a family reunion!” The male snow owl is a prankster, “a real wise guy.” We see a rose squirt water, then signs reading “MAGNOLIA” and “QUARREL CANYON.” They tell a story about him singing “Let It Snow” off-key, then pulling up to their house, where he had gotten it covered in snow for Christmas.</p><p>The male Snow Owl said he knew he’d be on the stage in a giant egg one day because he “loves wings.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: The Snow Owls’ performance of “Say Something” by A Great Big World was amazing. I loved the harmonies and it’s refreshing to hear a couple on the show! They clearly have chemistry together, which makes their performance nice to watch.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Robin thought it might be Amy Grant and Vince Gill. Jenny guessed Maureen McCormack and Barry Williams or Donnie and Marie Osmond. Ken predicted Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The First Masked Singer Season 4 Celebrity is Revealed!</h2><p>After all the performances, it was time for the first reveal. And the first one to be unmasked? The Dragon!</p><p>So which celebrity was under the mask?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Dragon is unmasked on The Masked Singer Season 4 Premiere</figure><p>It was…<strong>BUSTA RHYMES</strong>!</p><p>I’m sorry but wasn’t that obvious from his voice? Busta has such a distinct style so it’s not surprising at all it was him after hearing his performance. (And he also <a href=#>tweeted</a> about it earlier today.)</p><p>But such a fun way to kick off season 4! Next week, we’ll see six NEW celebrities in Group B. Just us then for more kooky action on The Masked Singer.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AGT-Americas-Got-Talent-Brandon-Leake-Daneliya-Tuleshova-Bad-Salsa.png alt="‘AGT’ Fans Outraged About Winner After Fan Favorites Fail To Make Top 5" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWarlZbAsLqMbWSpqpWitqa%2BxGapnpuRpXpzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1449358-good-evening-text-ideas-send-older-woman-crush-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Good evening text ideas to send to an older woman crush who is far away">&larr;
