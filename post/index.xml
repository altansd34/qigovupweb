But this wasn’t the launch of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;regular ship. The Titanic was the largest liner ever built at&amp;nbsp;the time. It&amp;nbsp;was 882 feet long&amp;nbsp;— that’s nearly the size of&amp;nbsp;three soccer fields! And measured from the hull to&amp;nbsp;the top of&amp;nbsp;the smokestacks, the ship was an&amp;nbsp;impressive 175 feet tall! That’s the size of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;17-story building. Deemed “unsinkable,” it&amp;nbsp;took 3,000 workers almost 3&amp;nbsp;years to&amp;nbsp;build. But a&amp;nbsp;mere four days into its very first voyage, at&amp;nbsp;11:40&amp;nbsp;PM, the ship collided with an&amp;nbsp;iceberg and was lost beneath the waves of&amp;nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean.</description></item><item><title>Hispanic Americans Want Hollywood to See Them as More Than Gang Members</title><link>/hispanic-americans-want-hollywood-to-see-them-as-more-than-gang-members.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/hispanic-americans-want-hollywood-to-see-them-as-more-than-gang-members.html</guid><description>Hispanic individuals are already underrepresented in film, according to an August 2019 report from the University of Southern California: Just 3 percent of the 100 top-grossing films each year from 2007 to 2018 starred Latino actors as the lead or co-lead.

According to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;study from the University of&amp;nbsp;Edinburgh, there might be&amp;nbsp;some truth to&amp;nbsp;this. According to&amp;nbsp;science, there are many ways a&amp;nbsp;person’s body features can influence how smart they are, and some are more surprising than others. We&amp;nbsp;might have been right about people who wear glasses being smart, but let’s just say a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;other stereotypes are completely off.
Bright Side brings you some body parts that science suggests could be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;sure sign of&amp;nbsp;higher brain power in&amp;nbsp;people.</description></item><item><title>10+ Utterly Amazing Photographs of Animals in the Womb</title><link>/15-utterly-amazing-photographs-of-animals-in-the-womb-39855.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-utterly-amazing-photographs-of-animals-in-the-womb-39855.html</guid><description>Researchers at&amp;nbsp;National Geographic have managed to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;something unbelievable: they succeeded in&amp;nbsp;taking photographs showing various animals growing inside their mother’s wombs.

But funnily enough, you don’t have to&amp;nbsp;make significant changes in&amp;nbsp;your home or&amp;nbsp;use complicated appliances. You can easily get these chores done with a&amp;nbsp;handful of&amp;nbsp;simple household items.

But the owners of&amp;nbsp;the cats we&amp;nbsp;want to&amp;nbsp;show you don’t agree with that: in&amp;nbsp;most cases, the animals dominate humans and try to&amp;nbsp;subdue them. And most actually succeed. Our pets are always able to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;us wash the dishes one more time and skip work if&amp;nbsp;they want.
Bright Side is&amp;nbsp;sure that we&amp;nbsp;all can forgive our 4-legged friends for their mischief, because their love is&amp;nbsp;boundless, though we&amp;nbsp;have a&amp;nbsp;hard time understanding it&amp;nbsp;from time to&amp;nbsp;time.</description></item><item><title>20 powerful prayer points for the church with supporting scripture</title><link>/1602275-powerful-prayer-points-church-supporting-scripture.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/1602275-powerful-prayer-points-church-supporting-scripture.html</guid><description>The church is a community of believers described as the body of Christ.

Tierno adds, that even brand-new clothes can still be&amp;nbsp;contaminated with germs, so&amp;nbsp;it’s definitely a&amp;nbsp;good idea to&amp;nbsp;take off the shirt you’ve been walking around for 12&amp;nbsp;hours&amp;nbsp;in, before sitting on&amp;nbsp;the bed.</description></item><item><title>Youre a Mom, Keke Palmers Boyfriend Shamed Her for Her Outfit and Got a Response He Didn</title><link>/youre-a-mom-keke-palmers-boyfriend-shamed-her-for-her-outfit-and-got-a-response-he-didnt-expect-813985.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/youre-a-mom-keke-palmers-boyfriend-shamed-her-for-her-outfit-and-got-a-response-he-didnt-expect-813985.html</guid><description>It’s an&amp;nbsp;undeniable fact that women are still being judged more harshly than men in&amp;nbsp;our society even when it’s for simple things, like leaving work a&amp;nbsp;bit early. But women have changed a&amp;nbsp;lot in&amp;nbsp;the past century, and they take upon so&amp;nbsp;many different roles. They are professionals, mothers and partners, and it&amp;nbsp;looks like they can’t fully please everyone around them. Keke Palmer’s example is&amp;nbsp;just another showcase that people will judge a&amp;nbsp;woman for her choices no&amp;nbsp;matter how close they are to&amp;nbsp;them.</description></item><item><title>'Go-Big Show' Contestant Breaks A World Record In The Semifinals</title><link>/go-big-show-contestant-breaks-a-world-record-in-the-semifinals.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/go-big-show-contestant-breaks-a-world-record-in-the-semifinals.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Talent Go-Big Show

But even though nowadays we&amp;nbsp;imagine a&amp;nbsp;furious ex&amp;nbsp;speaking up&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;response to&amp;nbsp;it, it&amp;nbsp;used to&amp;nbsp;have quite a&amp;nbsp;practical meaning in&amp;nbsp;the past.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side thought it&amp;nbsp;would be&amp;nbsp;interesting to&amp;nbsp;look into why someone can object at&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;wedding and to&amp;nbsp;share some real people’s stories about&amp;nbsp;it.

In&amp;nbsp;fact, it’s not makeup itself, but instead, the act of&amp;nbsp;neglecting to&amp;nbsp;remove it&amp;nbsp;properly before going to&amp;nbsp;bed that harms the skin.</description></item><item><title>15 Celebrity Siblings That Have Big Age Gaps</title><link>/15-celebrity-siblings-that-have-big-age-gaps-799509.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-celebrity-siblings-that-have-big-age-gaps-799509.html</guid><description>Many celebrities, like some of&amp;nbsp;us, have been lucky enough to&amp;nbsp;have siblings with whom to&amp;nbsp;share their life or&amp;nbsp;part of&amp;nbsp;it. Who could imagine, for example, that a&amp;nbsp;Marvel Avenger would spend a&amp;nbsp;Saturday afternoon helping his brother with his homework? Well, that’s the case of&amp;nbsp;many celebs you’ve probably seen in&amp;nbsp;movies or&amp;nbsp;heard on&amp;nbsp;the radio, especially those that have siblings with big age gaps. After all, regardless of&amp;nbsp;whether they are from the same blood or&amp;nbsp;not, siblings will always be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;source of&amp;nbsp;inspiration and a&amp;nbsp;good example.</description></item><item><title>17 Gorgeous Wolfdogs We Want to Hug and Never Let Go</title><link>/17-gorgeous-wolfdogs-we-want-to-hug-and-never-let-go-699810.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/17-gorgeous-wolfdogs-we-want-to-hug-and-never-let-go-699810.html</guid><description>In&amp;nbsp;order for a&amp;nbsp;wolfdog to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;born, a&amp;nbsp;domesticated dog and a&amp;nbsp;wolf have to&amp;nbsp;mate. The combination of&amp;nbsp;these 2&amp;nbsp;means that the dog can be&amp;nbsp;kept as&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;pet, but it&amp;nbsp;will usually have a&amp;nbsp;very aggressive temperament. However, they can easily be&amp;nbsp;tamed like domesticated dogs or&amp;nbsp;even used as&amp;nbsp;guard dogs if&amp;nbsp;they go&amp;nbsp;through a&amp;nbsp;rigorous training regimen.

A huge part of that non-verbal communication across cultures and countries is hand gestures—those movements and symbols we make to emphasize or clarify our statements and emotions, or sometimes to words altogether.
If you’ve ever traveled or have spent time with people from a different culture, you may have noticed that hand gestures vary.</description></item><item><title>20Fantastic Tattoos That Make Birthmarks and Scars Come Alive</title><link>/20-fantastic-tattoos-that-make-birthmarks-and-scars-come-alive-656760.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/20-fantastic-tattoos-that-make-birthmarks-and-scars-come-alive-656760.html</guid><description>Many people don’t like their birthmarks and scars, especially if&amp;nbsp;they attract too much attention and cause too many questions.

And sometimes it&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;hard to&amp;nbsp;distinguish one from the other. But once the caring behavior of&amp;nbsp;your partner makes you feel guilty, afraid, or&amp;nbsp;inferior, you should take it&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;sign that they might have control over you.
Bright Side always has your back. That’s why we&amp;nbsp;explored this topic deeper and can pinpoint situations when a&amp;nbsp;partner might cross the line between control and care.

No&amp;nbsp;parent is&amp;nbsp;ready to&amp;nbsp;receive an&amp;nbsp;unwelcoming diagnosis for their child, and staying positive in&amp;nbsp;these situations can be&amp;nbsp;hard. But the unconditional and pure love children give has the power to&amp;nbsp;make all your worries and fears fade away.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side love to&amp;nbsp;see how well these celebrities’ kids are doing, and we&amp;nbsp;hope it&amp;nbsp;will make your day brighter too.

Later, to&amp;nbsp;our regret or&amp;nbsp;happiness, real life puts everything in&amp;nbsp;its place. However, there are universal ways to&amp;nbsp;find out whether your relationship is&amp;nbsp;going to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;everlasting or&amp;nbsp;not.
Bright Side collected information about 9&amp;nbsp;factors in&amp;nbsp;your relationship that can predict whether you’ll live happily with your partner all your life. However, you should understand that not having matches with all of&amp;nbsp;them, is&amp;nbsp;not a&amp;nbsp;reason to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;upset&amp;nbsp;— everything is&amp;nbsp;very individual.</description></item><item><title>A Taiwanese Artist Creates Short Stories With Unexpected Plot Twists</title><link>/a-taiwanese-artist-creates-short-stories-with-unexpected-plot-twists-794804.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/a-taiwanese-artist-creates-short-stories-with-unexpected-plot-twists-794804.html</guid><description>“Exciting.
