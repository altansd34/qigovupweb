The young actress made her debut in the film industry in 1979 with an appearance in Savage Weekend, a slasher thriller. At the tender age of 13, she joined New York City’s prestigious HB Studios. Moreover, the talented lady learned ballet and dance at Joffrey and Ailie schools. Yancy later on studied Liberal Arts and earned her bachelor’s degree at Sarah Lawrence College in 1991.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/94954caa6a92f849.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Jade Tailor bio: age, height, ethnicity, movies and tv shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Fascinating details about the American actor Richard Beymer</p><h2>Yancy’s career, movies, and television shows</h2><p class=align-left>Within the same year after graduating from college, Butler landed a guest spot on <i>Law & Order</i>, the television series. Due to her outstanding performance, Dick Wolf, the creator-producer of the show, <a id=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000319/bio href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">offered her a chance</a> as the lead character in another new project, <i>Mann & Machine</i>, a science-fiction show that would begin the next year. Despite having a blossoming fan following, unfortunately, the film was cancelled. This was after they had worked on about nine episodes that left her fans longing for more.</p><p class=align-left>Soon afterward, the actress got another lead in <i>South Beach</i>, another great production from Dick Wolf. The series was also short-lived as only six episodes were aired.</p><p class=align-left>Notably, the film star scored highly in several popular action movies. For instance, in 1993, the actress was in <i>Hard Target</i> which also happened to be John Woo’s (legendary action auteur from Hong Kong) Hollywood debut. A year later, she was again on the screens this time alongside Wesley Snipes in <i>Drop Zone</i>, the skydiving suspense. The next years saw the star take up acting roles in independent and less-popular movies like <i>Annie’s Garden</i> and <i>Let It Be Me</i> (1994 and 1995 respectively). Moreover, she featured in several direct-to-video releases like <i>Fast Money</i> in 1995 and <i>The Ex and Ravager</i> in 1997.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2e18039faba321c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bio of Madelyn Cline: age, height, TV shows, boyfriend, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, during the same year (1997), she made a guest appearance on<i> NYPD Blue</i> in a role that would give her a next job in the Emmy Award winner <i>Brooklyn South</i>. The entire series was later to be cancelled after one season despite critical acclaim. The star later got to work in other less-memorable movies such as <i>The Treat </i>(1998), <i>Doomsday</i>, <i>The Witness Files</i> (both 1999), and the <i>New Adventures of Spin and Marty </i>(2000).</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Blindspot's Audrey Esparza: What you need to know about the stunning actress</p><p class=align-left>Also, in 2000, she nabbed the main character spot in <i>Witchblade</i>, which is a movie based on a popular comic book of the same name. Here, she portrays a troubled New York City cop, Detective Sara Pezzini, who ends up as keeper of the ancient weapon, Witchblade, which had been passed down through generations. This project had much success that the producers decided that it deserved to be expanded into a series.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f960da7baf33b3db.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about Jessica Brown Findlay: Age, career, and husband</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Interestingly, the decision was well thought off, and soon it became the top draw of the network that would brood a substantial fan-base. This led to more milestones for Butler as she appeared in Craig Kilborn’s The Late Late Show. She was also part of the panel in Politically Incorrect, a show where she used to cite Carl Jung, a famous psychologist, as they discussed gender roles.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the huge milestones and achievements by the actress, an unfortunate turn of events changed Butler’s life. During the production of the second season of Witchblade, she had to stay in rehab for one month due to <a id=https://www.streetdirectory.com/etoday/yancy-butler-from-witchblade-to-rehab-wweopu.html href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">alcohol abuse</a>. Fortunately, she recovered and could now return to complete the recording of the show. Surprisingly, the network pulled the plug despite the success of the series, and most believe that the real culprit was Yancy’s struggle with alcoholism.</p><p class=align-left>She took a year off from any form of filming but later returned with both supporting and lead roles in different independent productions. Her dedication and passion saw her land a section of <i>As the World Turns</i>, a daytime television soap opera, for several episodes.
