His captivating demeanor, combined with his British charm in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Interstellar</i></a>, made him the great performer he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today. The actor has recently <a href=# title=celebrated data-link=tag>celebrated</a> his 90th birthday, and as&nbsp;the years go&nbsp;by, he&nbsp;takes stock of&nbsp;what he&nbsp;has gone through, from humble beginnings to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;real cultural icon and acting legend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c74/d9f/ec8f315c53b4502e86fa10d21b.jpg><p>AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News</p><p><a href=# title=Poverty data-link=tag>Poverty</a> and hardship marked Caine’s <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>. His family lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small apartment with no&nbsp;indoor toilet, and his parents struggled to&nbsp;make ends meet. Michael <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attended</a> Wilson’s Grammar School in&nbsp;Camberwell but had to&nbsp;leave at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;16&nbsp;to&nbsp;work and help support his family.</p><p>He&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;severe poverty, which has influenced his entire life. Reminiscing about that time, Michael <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “<a href=# title=Money data-link=tag>Money</a> was the only thing my&nbsp;young life lacked. I&nbsp;never had any money until&nbsp;I was&nbsp;29, so&nbsp;I was very much a&nbsp;formed character before the money could spoil&nbsp;me. Everyone’s poor in&nbsp;my&nbsp;family, so&nbsp;I’ve always controlled everything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/307/642a285680b30e9febb8ba8337.jpg><p>Michael takes&nbsp;us back to&nbsp;those humble times of&nbsp;his upbringing, saying, “In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;keep me&nbsp;with her, my&nbsp;mother took a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cook in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rich man’s country house, and that’s undoubtedly why I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;very good cook today. My&nbsp;mother cooked for the family. I&nbsp;would wait in&nbsp;the kitchen to&nbsp;eat the leftover pheasant and grouse. <strong>The way&nbsp;I live today is&nbsp;recreating that idyllic country house of&nbsp;my&nbsp;childhood</strong>.”</p><p>Yet, despite the fact that it&nbsp;was challenging, Caine has often credited his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>childhood</a> for giving him the drive and determination to&nbsp;succeed in&nbsp;his career. He&nbsp;has stated that his experiences growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;poverty helped him to&nbsp;connect with the working-class characters he&nbsp;has played throughout his acting career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ee/41e/0fa9a15d8cbf8d6bcd67e13e31.jpg><p>NIVIERE/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Caine has been married to&nbsp;his second wife, Shakira Baksh, since 1973. Baksh is&nbsp;a&nbsp;former model and beauty queen from Guyana, and the couple met in&nbsp;the early 1970s at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. They have been together for over 40&nbsp;years and have been seen as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most enduring <a href=# title=marriages data-link=tag>marriages</a> in&nbsp;Hollywood. “I&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with her in&nbsp;about eight minutes,” Michael <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “It&nbsp;took her two hours to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Their love life blossomed, and even though the actor had reached great success, and met many charming women, Shakira always <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remained</a> the one. “That could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great temptation, so&nbsp;I decided that&nbsp;I would never marry a&nbsp;woman who wasn’t as&nbsp;beautiful as&nbsp;the women&nbsp;I was working with. And I&nbsp;married a&nbsp;woman who, in&nbsp;actual fact, is&nbsp;more beautiful than most women&nbsp;I have worked with, so&nbsp;all the temptation was at&nbsp;home, not at&nbsp;work.”</p><p>Despite being together for so&nbsp;long, the couple has remained relatively private about their personal life, but the actor has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> a&nbsp;tip to&nbsp;make his marriage endure for so&nbsp;long. “The secret is&nbsp;separate bathrooms. Never share a&nbsp;bathroom with a&nbsp;woman.”</p><h2>The first <a href=#>gigs</a> to&nbsp;gather a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;money.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c09/3d5/53b1095732b68bf2a4c2dbc318.jpg><p>Album Online/East News</p><p>When he&nbsp;first approached a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>career</a> in&nbsp;acting, Michael wasn’t too fussy about the parts he&nbsp;took because his major goal was to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. In&nbsp;fact, since the beginning of&nbsp;his performing debut, the actor has widely discussed his financial needs. He’s also mentioned the failure of&nbsp;several of&nbsp;his roles. “I&nbsp;made a&nbsp;load of&nbsp;hilariously bad flops,” Michael <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a>.</p><p>Reminiscing about his first gigs, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;became an&nbsp;actor knowing that&nbsp;I would never be&nbsp;a&nbsp;star. I&nbsp;would never be&nbsp;rich, and&nbsp;I would never be&nbsp;famous. All I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was to&nbsp;become the best actor&nbsp;I could become. I&nbsp;became an&nbsp;actor, but my&nbsp;father wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;the fish market where he&nbsp;worked.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/909/cd844c54989c0392c8823376b0.jpg><p>AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News</p><p>Michael struggled to&nbsp;break into the acting industry, and despite his efforts, he&nbsp;had little success at&nbsp;first. As&nbsp;Caine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a>, this condition made most of&nbsp;his friends abandon him.</p><p>“When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;young actor, I&nbsp;was very poor. I&nbsp;couldn’t buy a&nbsp;round in&nbsp;the pub, and they stopped talking to&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;all my&nbsp;friends were rich people&nbsp;I met later, fortunately. Roger Moore and Sean ­Connery are the 2&nbsp;actors that I’m closest&nbsp;to.”</p><h2>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;now one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s most <a href=#>recognized</a> actors.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/73a/79c/e23a225a2aaeae02753fa4e58a.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>But sooner or&nbsp;later, his talent surfaced, and he&nbsp;did get his first leading role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Zulu</i></a>. Yet, it&nbsp;wasn’t until the mid-1960s when he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Alfie</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Ipcress File</i></a>, that Caine’s career really took off. Ever since then, he&nbsp;has become one of&nbsp;the most successful and well-respected actors of&nbsp;his generation.</p><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a>, “The day&nbsp;I became Michael Caine, that was it&nbsp;— I&nbsp;was Michael Caine. I&nbsp;wasn’t Maurice anymore. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;completely different person. And it&nbsp;was amazing. It&nbsp;was fabulous. He&nbsp;was broke. He&nbsp;was out of&nbsp;work. And the moment&nbsp;I became Michael Caine, I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;job and was on&nbsp;my&nbsp;way.”</p><h2>Michael celebrated his 90th birthday alongside <a href=#>longtime</a> friends.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1d/0eb/cb68eb58e29ee50cd780756912.jpg><p>Michael has reached the age of&nbsp;90, and he&nbsp;now reflects on&nbsp;his life and career <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I’ve done 150&nbsp;movies. I&nbsp;think I’ve done enough.” Considering Caine’s stunning presence in&nbsp;cinema for such a&nbsp;long time, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;unsettling to&nbsp;consider the scene without him.</p><p>With a&nbsp;career spanning over 6&nbsp;decades, Michael is&nbsp;now prioritizing his family and his nearly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>50-year</a> marriage to&nbsp;his wife, Shakira Caine, with whom he’s madly in&nbsp;love. “My&nbsp;family and extended family<strong> </strong>and the way we&nbsp;live are the most important things to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;this life.

The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>90th</a> birthday celebration for Michael Caine in&nbsp;London was a&nbsp;special event, and Tom didn’t want to&nbsp;miss&nbsp;it, to&nbsp;the point that he&nbsp;also skipped the Oscars this year.</p><p>The 2&nbsp;have been friends for a&nbsp;long time after working together on&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Austin Powers in&nbsp;Goldmember</i></a>. However, other celebs also joined them, including David Walliams, who posted images and videos from the event on&nbsp;social media.</p><p>After such an&nbsp;accomplished life, there would be&nbsp;no&nbsp;better way to&nbsp;celebrate this achievement other than surrounded by&nbsp;his loved ones. Having temporarily distanced himself from the world of&nbsp;Hollywood, Caine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “<strong>My&nbsp;life is&nbsp;not acting or&nbsp;Hollywood</strong>. My&nbsp;family is&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. Relationships and friends, that’s all I&nbsp;need. Whether I’m working or&nbsp;not, at&nbsp;half past 5, I&nbsp;take off my&nbsp;shoes and have a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;tea. I&nbsp;don’t let this business rule&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Preview photo credit Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>NIVIERE/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ymoJygkZq5bq%2FAoqWeZZ%2BrsrOvwKacZqifq7KzwNhmq6hlopqupLSMrZ%2BeZaCeu6%2BtwqWcZqeWYrWwuMuyrqinlGLAta3RnaamZWhmf3R8lWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./22632-italian-cuisine-worlds-most-popular.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Italian cuisine is worlds most popular">&larr;
