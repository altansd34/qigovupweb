post-container"><p>One survey reflected a&nbsp;major <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shift</a> in&nbsp;the film industry&nbsp;— 36% of&nbsp;people said they would rather stream movies at&nbsp;home, while only&nbsp;14% preferred to&nbsp;watch flicks the old school way at&nbsp;the theatre. But no&nbsp;matter where the setting&nbsp;is, a&nbsp;good film will engage its audience with a&nbsp;captivating plot and appealing visuals. And sometimes, the actors’ personal touches on&nbsp;the script or&nbsp;behind-the-scenes accounts can also make our viewing experience more interesting.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>gathered<strong> </strong>10&nbsp;fascinating tidbits that happened on&nbsp;set during a&nbsp;movie production, and they might change the way you view the actors’ characters and their scenes.</p><p><h2>1. Chris Hemsworth kissed his wife in&nbsp;the final scene of&nbsp;<i>Thor: The Dark World.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a76/cea/4354305a14a6f09c94a49deb45.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the movie, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Asgardian</a> God of&nbsp;Thunder, Thor, traveled back to&nbsp;Earth to&nbsp;see Dr. Jane Foster (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Natalie Portman" data-link=tag>Natalie Portman</a>), and they shared a&nbsp;passionate kiss. Fans may have noticed that the on-screen smooch had a&nbsp;bit more flame in&nbsp;it, and that’s because Hemsworth was actually kissing his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wife</a>, Elsa Pataky, who stood in&nbsp;for Portman. At&nbsp;that time, the <i>Black Swan </i>actress couldn’t make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the reshoots, so&nbsp;the team had to&nbsp;improvise.</p><p>In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>, Hemsworth said that when they asked him to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;different talent for the kissing scene, he&nbsp;mentioned that his wife was just around the corner and suggested bringing her in&nbsp;instead. His idea worked&nbsp;— the romance felt more real and he&nbsp;jokingly added, “I&nbsp;wouldn’t have to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;her what I’ve been doing at&nbsp;work if&nbsp;I’m having to&nbsp;kiss someone else.”</p><p><h2>2. Stephanie Beatriz went into labor while recording her solo song for <i>Encanto.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b95/623/2a224c5ab386c9359b4151772c.jpg><p>One thing that makes a&nbsp;film remarkable is&nbsp;the commitment the actor has to&nbsp;the role. And there’s no&nbsp;question about Stephanie Beatriz’s devotion to&nbsp;her craft because, aside from making a&nbsp;film while she was pregnant, she also recorded <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mirabel Madrigal’s</a> song while having contractions. Interestingly, the track’s title was “Waiting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Miracle,” and the actress happened to&nbsp;have her own little miracle on&nbsp;the way.</p><p>Beatriz <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that on&nbsp;the day they were scheduled to&nbsp;record the song, she was in&nbsp;labor but didn’t want to&nbsp;alarm the Disney producers. So&nbsp;she went in&nbsp;with her fingers crossed and hoped to&nbsp;finish the song before the baby arrived. The film’s director, Byron Howard, admitted that they knew she was due soon, but they had no&nbsp;idea it&nbsp;was <i>that </i>close. Beatriz gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy baby girl the very next day.</p><p><h2>3. Martin Scorsese’s mom made a&nbsp;cameo and cooked the mouthwatering food in&nbsp;his movie, <i>Goodfellas.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e9/5ad/c548265b68b8d2479fa34f880a.jpg><p>We&nbsp;don’t really expect an&nbsp;iconic cooking scene to&nbsp;come out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;crime drama film, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Goodfellas</i></a><i> </i>is&nbsp;yet another testament to&nbsp;Scorsese’s outstanding directorial abilities. In&nbsp;this movie, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;little help from his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a>, Catherine, who made a&nbsp;cameo as&nbsp;the mom of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>antagonist</a> Tommy DeVito (played by&nbsp;Joe Pesci). But Mrs. Scorsese didn’t just share her acting talents&nbsp;— she shared her recipes too.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the prison scenes featured the preparation of&nbsp;her homemade meat sauce, and it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;intoxicatingly good that it&nbsp;made viewers want to&nbsp;recreate&nbsp;it (lucky for&nbsp;us, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recipe</a> is&nbsp;available online). According to&nbsp;Scorsese, his mother’s presence and her food helped produce an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>organic</a> familial atmosphere on&nbsp;set. “My&nbsp;mother treated (them like) real <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> members because we’ve known each other for so&nbsp;long and, to&nbsp;her, it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;son’s friends (who) were making a&nbsp;movie,” he&nbsp;added.</p><p><h2>4. Chris Pratt had a&nbsp;funny way of&nbsp;getting into character in&nbsp;<i>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9b/6b0/d436015524867f79fd8913726f.jpg><p><a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a>’s background, after starring in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sitcom</a>, <i>Parks and Recreation, </i>added to&nbsp;his image as&nbsp;a&nbsp;goofy guy. And his sense of&nbsp;humor was quite evident in&nbsp;the film, <i>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy. </i>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tweet</a>, movie director James Gunn revealed that whenever Pratt’s character (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Star-Lord</a>) fires his space weapon, the actor makes “pew pew” sounds.</p><p>The director added that Pratt wasn’t even aware of&nbsp;it&nbsp;until he&nbsp;was called out. The actor’s adorable habit may have caused some reshoots, but Gunn said he&nbsp;didn’t mind and that it&nbsp;was, in&nbsp;fact, one of&nbsp;his favorite things. It&nbsp;probably added more giggles and good vibes to&nbsp;the set too.</p><p><h2>5. Emma Watson’s pet passed away on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, </i>and the crew helped her through&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10d/ba5/0ba5c050e28738391de68594b0.jpg><p>After working together in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>8</a>&nbsp;films, the cast of&nbsp;the <i><a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> </i>series undoubtedly shares a&nbsp;very special bond. In&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary Special</i>,<i> </i>Emma<i> </i>Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> how they took care of&nbsp;each other during production. Watson, a.k.a. Hermione, once said in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>speech</a> that she found a&nbsp;“surrogate family” in&nbsp;the movie industry.</p><p>When Watson’s childhood hamster passed away, the cast and crew helped her through her grief. They were shooting when it&nbsp;happened, so&nbsp;the set designers made her a&nbsp;tiny coffin, which was lined with velvet and had “Millie” (the hamster’s name) engraved on&nbsp;it. Grint recalled that the cast even “said a&nbsp;few words,” which just goes to&nbsp;show that the chemistry they all share on-screen exists in&nbsp;real life too.</p><p><h2>6. Arnold Schwarzenegger helped a&nbsp;co-actor in&nbsp;<i>Total Recall </i>who was dealing with personal problems during the shoot.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/742/2c9/a188465821b6acaf66be1bc53e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a>, Michael Ironside’s character, Richter, is&nbsp;the antagonist to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>’s fictional persona, Quaid. But when the cameras stopped rolling, the 2&nbsp;actors are actually were good friends. According to&nbsp;reports, Schwarzenegger <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noticed</a> that Ironside was often on&nbsp;the phone in&nbsp;between takes, and he&nbsp;eventually learned that his co-star’s sister was extremely sick.</p><p>Ironside <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> Schwarzenegger that he&nbsp;was sad about not being able to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;his sister (there were no&nbsp;Internet and cellphones at&nbsp;that time), and the former bodybuilder offered to&nbsp;help. They went to&nbsp;his trailer where he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;phone, and Ironside shared that he&nbsp;got emotional when he&nbsp;heard Schwarzenegger genuinely expressing his concern for his sibling. It&nbsp;was that moment that cemented their <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>.</p><p><h2>7. What we&nbsp;saw as&nbsp;a&nbsp;spine-chilling corridor scene from <i>The Shining </i>was actually child actor Danny Lloyd having fun on&nbsp;his ride.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/967/11f/32738059b280dbb559a9a344b5.jpg><p>Danny Lloyd was only 5&nbsp;years old when they filmed the horror flick, and to&nbsp;protect him, director Stanley Kubrick hid the truth about the terrifying plot. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Lloyd’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>memories</a> from production are mostly happy events, like an&nbsp;Easter egg hunt and eating peanut butter sandwiches with his co-stars.</p><p>And in&nbsp;the terrifying scene of&nbsp;little Danny anxiously pedaling his “bike” along the hotel corridor, what Lloyd really remembers is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was reeling with excitement from being allowed to&nbsp;ride the tricycle indoors. Now, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;muster enough courage to&nbsp;re-watch the horror classic, maybe our knowledge of&nbsp;Lloyd happily driving through the hall will soften the horror in&nbsp;that clip.</p><p><h2>8. Tom Cruise declared his love for his family while doing a&nbsp;daredevil stunt for <i>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30c/cec/513da35916826e628c9c2bf7e5.jpg><p>The <i>Mission Impossible </i>film series never fails to&nbsp;deliver heart-stopping action scenes, and its fourth installment contained some of&nbsp;the most harrowing stunts <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> has ever done. His spy character, Ethan Hunt, had to&nbsp;scale the world’s tallest building&nbsp;— the 2,722-foot-high <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Burj Khalifa</a>. To&nbsp;complete the stunt, Cruise reportedly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>climbed</a> a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;elevators and an&nbsp;estimated 200 feet of&nbsp;ladders to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the top.</p><p>Reaching the structure’s peak is&nbsp;no&nbsp;ordinary feat, so&nbsp;Cruise made the most out of&nbsp;his time up&nbsp;there. He&nbsp;was quoted <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> that he&nbsp;crawled over to&nbsp;the side to&nbsp;sign the names of&nbsp;his kids and <a href=# title="Katie Holmes" data-link=tag>Katie Holmes</a> (who was still his wife back then), and he&nbsp;finished the markings by&nbsp;writing that he&nbsp;loved them. Talk about setting the bar <i>really</i> high!</p><p><h2>9. Jennifer Lawrence got her nephews to&nbsp;play her children in&nbsp;the last scene of&nbsp;<i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay.</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/180/f8d/619fa15c71a884e5ce2b31aede.jpg><p>To&nbsp;the satisfaction of<i>&nbsp;</i>fans, the film series ended with a&nbsp;calm and peaceful shot of&nbsp;Katniss (<a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a>) and Peeta (Joshua Hutcherson) and their 2&nbsp;kids. Lawrence later revealed that this was a&nbsp;very special moment for her because the kids in&nbsp;the scene were actually her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nephews</a>.</p><p>The older one with Peeta was her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oldest</a> nephew, Bear, and the one in&nbsp;her arms was the 9-month-old Theo. The actress explained that having her blood family within the scene served as&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing closure to&nbsp;the character that she had given life to&nbsp;and loved for so&nbsp;many years.</p><p><h2>10. The song that John Krasinski and Emily Blunt danced to&nbsp;in&nbsp;one scene from <i>A&nbsp;Quiet Place </i>had a&nbsp;special meaning for them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a2/e42/5e07205b2a92d019e93c600f9d.jpg><p>Krasinski has been vocal about the movie being a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“love letter”</a> to&nbsp;his kids because it&nbsp;shows what parents will go&nbsp;through to&nbsp;protect their children. But the entire film is&nbsp;also full of&nbsp;references to&nbsp;his loving relationship with his wife, who is&nbsp;also the leading actress in&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;one emotional scene, the couple, very quietly, slow dances to&nbsp;Neil Young’s 1990s love track, “Harvest Moon.” Apparently, they chose to&nbsp;include this tune in&nbsp;the movie for a&nbsp;reason. Krasinski <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;their dear friends got married to&nbsp;that song, and it&nbsp;was the perfect choice for a&nbsp;part that had no&nbsp;dialogue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ca/8ab/6f0d455de7a3525932ef21ecdd.jpg><p>But wait, there’s more! Fans who followed Krasinski’s career also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> that the “sharing of&nbsp;the earbuds” sequence looked strangely familiar. And they were quick to&nbsp;point out that it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;the actor’s subtle nod to&nbsp;his previous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sitcom</a>, <i>The Office, </i>because one of&nbsp;the sweetest moments in&nbsp;the show was when Jim (Krasinski) shared the earphones with Pam (Jenna Fischer).</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know other movie trivia that makes films way more interesting? What is&nbsp;the most surprising behind-the-scenes tidbit that you’ve heard so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Tom Cruise’s unique characteristics set him apart in&nbsp;Hollywood. From being recognized as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most handsome men in&nbsp;the world to&nbsp;performing his own daring stunts, Cruise’s <a href=#>dedication to&nbsp;his craft</a> is&nbsp;unparalleled. His refusal to&nbsp;use stunt doubles, his impressive box office records, and his compassionate nature further highlight his distinctiveness. Additionally, his intriguing relationships with numbers, adventurous spirit, and humility make him an&nbsp;extraordinary figure in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecyopJ6mpKh6p77OpmSam6Skv7R5zqdkrJ2kYsGprdNmpJqclWLBqbHIq2Smp6aesrR5xLGrq5ldqL2mr8iao2ZwYGx%2Bd4KO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-characters-that-were-played-by-different-actors-and-we-cant-decide-who-did-it-better-806640.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Characters That Were Played by Different Actors, and We Cant Decide Who Did It Better">&larr;
