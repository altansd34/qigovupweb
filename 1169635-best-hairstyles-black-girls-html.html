HHC explained that:</p>Children with curly hair textures aren’t advised to try some hairstyles because of the outcome or the longevity of the hair. Parents basically want hairstyles that last for a week or more to avoid back-to-back salon visits that cause manipulations on the hair.For basic hair needs, children most of the time need have a detailed treatment for their hair. For example, cornrows(weaves) do not last for some hair textures and we advise their parents to avoid them.<h2>Which hairstyle is best for a girl?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f9cb8f4ba4dee1ff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top children hairstyle ideas in 2019</span></p></a><ul><li>Cornrows tied into a bun, two buns, or three buns.</li><li>Cornrows tied into a ponytail or several pigtails.</li><li>Braid strands tied into a bun, two buns, or three buns.</li><li>Braid strands tied into a ponytail or several pigtails.</li><li>Cornrows with a bun(s) and bangs hanging at the front of your head.</li><li>Braids with a bun(s) and bangs hanging at the front of your head.</li><li>Cornrows with a ponytail or several pigtails and bangs hanging at the front of your head.</li><li>Braids with a ponytail or several pigtails and bangs hanging at the front of your head.</li></ul><h2>What hairstyle looks best?</h2><ul><li>Cornrows with a mohawk design.</li><li>Braids or cornrows with beads.</li><li>Cornrows with bun(s), ponytails, or pigtails made from synthetic hair extensions.</li><li>Natural hair tied in a bun(s), ponytails, or pigtails made from artificial hair extensions.</li></ul><h2>How to look cute in hairstyles?</h2><p class=align-left>You can look beautiful in any hairstyle that matches your skin tone and face shape.
