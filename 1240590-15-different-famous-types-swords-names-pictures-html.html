Despite the numerous variations in material used in making blades, the specific use, and efficiency of use, the fact remains that different types of swords were commonly used for slashing and thrusting. This is given to their somewhat longer blade compared to knife or daggers, and their handle known as hilt that consisted of a guard, grip, and pommel.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a2814614a1681d64.jpg><p class=align-left>Did you know that the use of a sword over the past years is referred to as swordsmanship? Currently, most people relate blades usage to fencing. A look at the various pictures of swords from the archaeological collections and historical records, you will notice that the swords vary in either material, shape, length, among other factors. This can be summarized into three significant classification of swords.</p><h2>1. Material used</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d526b2a9a0ee73f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreadlocks, 4 other ancient amazing African beauty trends still popular in today's world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As mentioned earlier, some of the earliest blades were created during the Bronze Age. I am referring to the period of 1600 BC. This was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">followed by the Iron Age</a> where Iron became the dominant material in sword smith craftsmanship. However, after the 8th century, BC is when the iron swords became dominant but yet did not possess the crossguards (quillon). Then later came the European sword during the Middle Ages and the Late Roman army sword, Migration Period sword, High Middle Ages, among others.</p><h2>2. Usage of sword designs</h2><p class=align-left>As an attacking and defensive weapon, blade designs much dependent on the particular opponent’s defensive tactics and on how the user would apply it during the warfare. You will find that for those communities that used horses in the battlefield, their blades were more to look like scimitar hence a curved blade with a broadened tip. On the other hand, most early civilizations that fought on ground preferred the rapier-like swords. These were quite thin and light sharp. Their primary usage was thrusting.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/489f81d868f75440.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All lightsaber color meanings explained: a comprehensive guide</span></p></a><h2>3. Speed and efficiency</h2><p class=align-left>When it comes to warfare, speed is the primary determinant of life and death. As the human understanding of the technological application of blades increased, much "rapier" like sword inventions were embraced. A combination of material, shape, and speed led to the development of some of the lethal blades in human history. A good example is the “Katana Sword” that is dubbed as the Samurai Sword.</p><h2>Types of swords</h2><p class=align-left>From the Asian, Egyptian, rapiers, two-handed, long, and even short blades, I present you with a list of 15 names of swords and sword types with exclusive pictures of the types of blades. This will be effective in enlighting you on the history of blades and to act as a guide for those interested in buying or placing orders of the different blade selling websites and online shops across the world.</p><h3>1.

A good example is the famous actor Tom Cruise, who uses Katana in the classic movie "The Last Samurai." Katana ranges from 24 to 30 inches in length. The sharp one bladed sword achieved universal application due to its widespread use in the 14th and 16th centuries (Feudal Period), only to be restricted to army usage in the Meiji Period. It possesses a circular/squared guard and two-handed grips.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/af0bfe7b41ed170d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KonMarie: a method for cleaning the house</span></p></a><h3>2.
