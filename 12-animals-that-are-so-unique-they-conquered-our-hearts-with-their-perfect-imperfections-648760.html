While we&nbsp;see imperfections as&nbsp;rare, veterinarian Dr. Timothy D. Hodge notes that congenital defects are <a href=#>more common than we&nbsp;think</a>. He&nbsp;lists cleft palates and limb deformities as&nbsp;particularly common. The reasons behind birth defects are largely unknown, but they continue to&nbsp;affect wild and domestic animals worldwide.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side we&nbsp;</strong>have compiled a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;animals who were born a&nbsp;little different, to&nbsp;prove that they can still melt your heart.</p><p><h2>1. Tickled...green?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd2/f28/e664cd5a5ab9fc75a9f04b0f74.jpg><p>This strange-looking marsupial was orphaned in&nbsp;Melbourne, and lost most of&nbsp;his fur due to&nbsp;the stress of&nbsp;being separated from his mother. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;turn of&nbsp;ill fate, he&nbsp;also developed a&nbsp;fungal infection, which made his skin appear green under certain lights. This occasional green hue earned him the name “Shrek” and he&nbsp;has since been tended to&nbsp;by&nbsp;the <a href=#>Maryknoll Wildlife Shelter</a>. Despite his unfortunate circumstances, we&nbsp;think Shrek might be&nbsp;the most huggable wombat ever.</p><p><h2>2. Sweet Sasha</h2></p><p>This adorable pup has been singled out since birth, having been born with a&nbsp;<strong>disproportionately large head</strong> and a&nbsp;<strong>cleft palate</strong>. She was nursed by&nbsp;<a href=#>SNARR Animal Rescue</a> in&nbsp;New York and touched many hearts as&nbsp;she clung onto life in&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;her health issues. Having battled for the better part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;year, and bonded with the team’s foster kittens, Sasha is&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;those who have fought through hard times. We&nbsp;find her beautiful despite her “flaws.”</p><p><h2>3. Roux the T-rex</h2></p><p>Roux is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful Siamese mix kitty who lives in&nbsp;New Orleans with her loving owner. At&nbsp;first glance, she doesn’t seem particularly different, but her missing front legs will soon make you realize that she’s not like the rest of&nbsp;her species. This has earned her the affectionate title, “T-rex,” and with her playful nature, Roux proves that no&nbsp;legs can also be&nbsp;no&nbsp;problem.</p><p><h2>4. Smushie the Cat</h2></p><p>Smushie the Cat was found as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stray on&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Richmond, Virginia. With an&nbsp;<strong>underdeveloped nose</strong> and a&nbsp;<strong>cleft palate</strong>, Smushie was all alone before being welcomed into her forever home. Although her nasal issues can cause <strong>breathing difficulties</strong>, we&nbsp;can’t get over how cute she looks and we’re so&nbsp;glad she’s found loving owners despite her <strong>facial quirks</strong>.</p><p><h2>5. Great things come in&nbsp;short packages</h2></p><p>Quasimodo—also known as&nbsp;"<a href=#>Quasi the Great</a>“—is a&nbsp;German Shepherd with <strong>short spine syndrome</strong>. This “<a href=#>severe shortening of&nbsp;the vertebrae column</a>” means that Quasi has the appearance of&nbsp;being <strong>hunch-backed</strong>. This makes him smaller than the other dogs of&nbsp;his breed and reduces the span his back and torso considerably. However, this <strong>spinal compression</strong> hasn’t affected his charming <a href=#>puppy eyes</a>, and we&nbsp;find him completely irresistible.</p><p><h2>6. Alba the Orangutan</h2></p><p>Sweet little Alba made worldwide headlines when she was featured in&nbsp;<a href=#>Orangutan Jungle School</a>. While her condition could be&nbsp;more accurately called <a href=#>leucism</a>, this snowy beauty is&nbsp;famed as&nbsp;the first known <strong>albino</strong> orangutan, and she has stolen many hearts with her piercing blue eyes and not-so-orange coat. Despite looking different to&nbsp;her classmates, Alba proved herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;confident young ape and was quickly accepted into the group. She may be&nbsp;the only one of&nbsp;her kind, but that hasn’t stopped her from receiving the love and friendship she deserves.</p><p><h2>7. Mr. Bigglesworth</h2></p><p>Bunnies are known for being cute, white-tailed, and super fluffy. While Mr. Bigglesworth scores 2/3, his <strong>genetic disorder</strong> means <strong>his fur comes and goes</strong> sporadically—and usually in&nbsp;patches. This little Rex rabbit was rescued after being deemed unsellable and has since become a&nbsp;viral sensation (he&nbsp;even has his own <a href=#>merchandise</a>). Mr. Bigglesworth’s stardom shows the world that it’s okay to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unconventional, and he’s won over many followers in&nbsp;the process.</p><p><h2>8. Seeing double</h2></p><p>It’s likely this isn’t the first time you’ve seen an&nbsp;animal with <strong>2&nbsp;different eye colors</strong>. This condition is&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;<strong>an&nbsp;excess or&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;melanin</strong>, and is&nbsp;usually <strong>genetic</strong>. As&nbsp;with most deviances in&nbsp;appearance, “<a href=#>heterochromia iris</a>” has sparked many myths and superstitions. While the condition can cause <strong>sensitivity</strong>, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;generally harmless and—as this precious cat shows—can be&nbsp;strikingly beautiful.</p><p><h2>9. Tuna Melt</h2></p><p>This adorable “chiweenie” named Tuna was born with an&nbsp;<strong>overbite</strong>, which gives him an&nbsp;unusual appearance (and a&nbsp;pretty consistently shocked expression). Tuna went viral after his owner posted pictures of&nbsp;the pup in&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;costumes, and quickly became a&nbsp;hit with his <strong>distinctive features</strong>. He&nbsp;now has <a href=#>2&nbsp;million followers</a> on&nbsp;Instagram. Tuna definitely melts our hearts by&nbsp;showing that beauty comes in&nbsp;many forms and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;loyal ambassador for rescue dogs everywhere.</p><p><h2>10. White winged</h2></p><p>This beady-eyed beauty is&nbsp;named <strong>Taln’gai Dha’run</strong>, meaning “<strong>white wing</strong>.” Named after his <strong>white pigmentation</strong>, Taln’gai is&nbsp;<strong>leucistic</strong>, which means he&nbsp;looks a&nbsp;little different than his fellow flyers. The <strong>retention of&nbsp;some blackness</strong> around his ears and stomach gives him an&nbsp;appearance unlike any other bat. When he&nbsp;was rescued, Taln’gai’s feet were <strong>sunburnt</strong>, and he&nbsp;was even <a href=#>mistaken for a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;discarded paper</a>. Despite his abnormalities, we&nbsp;think Taln’gai is&nbsp;enchantingly cute and has come a&nbsp;long way since his orphaned days.</p><p><h2>11. Darling Doby</h2></p><p>California-based Doby is&nbsp;a&nbsp;house cat with <strong>cerebellar hypoplasia</strong>. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>neurological condition</a> that makes Doby a&nbsp;little wobblier than his furry friends. Along with this, Doby has a&nbsp;<strong>cleft nose</strong>, which makes him look like his nose is&nbsp;divided in&nbsp;half. He&nbsp;found a&nbsp;loving home after being rescued and we&nbsp;think he’s beautiful just the way he&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>12. Little Mimi</h2></p><p>Mimi the rabbit was <strong>born without ears</strong>, and with <strong>only 3&nbsp;legs</strong>. Her difficult circumstances meant that she was the odd one out amongst her bunny pals. While Mimi’s owner makes her <a href=#>adorable knitted ears</a>, Mimi embraces her differences and still manages to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the cutest bunnies we’ve ever seen.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these unique-looking animals surprised you the most?
