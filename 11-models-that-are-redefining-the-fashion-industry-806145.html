And with each passing decade, new design proposals arrive, and the perception of&nbsp;beauty standards is&nbsp;also transformed. We&nbsp;are increasingly realizing that true beauty comes in&nbsp;all shapes and sizes, and those differences are what make&nbsp;us shine with our own light.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;love reading the stories of&nbsp;people who not only dared to&nbsp;dream but went for&nbsp;it. Today, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share these powerful models who are leaving an&nbsp;important mark on&nbsp;their way through the runways and inspire&nbsp;us with their unique beauty.</p><p><h2>1. Marsha Elle, bionic model</h2></p><p>This model, singer, and songwriter is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;motivational speaker who inspires&nbsp;us all to&nbsp;pursue our dreams. Marsha Elle was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> with a&nbsp;proximal femoral focal deficiency, a&nbsp;birth defect that caused her leg to&nbsp;fail to&nbsp;develop sufficiently, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, her leg was amputated shortly after birth.</p><p>Growing up&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;amputee, Marsha Elle went through a&nbsp;process of&nbsp;recognition and acceptance. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>learned</a> to&nbsp;put aside her insecurities and embrace her body, using her power to&nbsp;inspire others. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry like fashion, where everything comes down to&nbsp;looks, Marsha found a&nbsp;space to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;statement.</p><p>She has participated in&nbsp;several fashion campaigns, and one of&nbsp;her most recent appearances was as&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;the Adidas and Afropunk <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>collaboration</a>. She lets the world <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>know</a> that you shouldn’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;step out of&nbsp;your comfort zone, empowering others to&nbsp;be&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;their differences and love themselves.</p><p><h2>2. Jillian Mercado, muscular dystrophy</h2></p><p>Jillian Mercado has made a&nbsp;name for herself in&nbsp;the fashion industry. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>model</a> born in&nbsp;New York and raised by&nbsp;Dominican parents, and from a&nbsp;very young age, she developed a&nbsp;love for fashion. In&nbsp;her early teens, she was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. Although there are some stigmas surrounding the industry, Jillian was eager to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;change in&nbsp;the inequality of&nbsp;opportunities for the <a href=# title=disabled data-link=tag>disabled</a> community.</p><p>She seeks to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more than a&nbsp;model, but a&nbsp;role model for those facing a&nbsp;similar situation. Her first big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>modeling</a> job was with Diesel in&nbsp;2014, followed by&nbsp;other campaigns for Nordstrom, Target, and once, she modeled for Beyoncé’s Formation world tour merchandise.</p><p><h2>3. Melissa Koole, Autism</h2></p><p>This model from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Holland</a> is&nbsp;not ashamed of&nbsp;letting the world know about her condition and is&nbsp;raising awareness of&nbsp;<a href=# title=autism data-link=tag>autism</a>. Melissa Koole was diagnosed at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;19&nbsp;with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Asperger’s</a> syndrome, a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;autism that affects people’s social and communication skills.</p><p>Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>career</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model was not easy at&nbsp;first due to&nbsp;her Asperger’s. But once she decided that her condition would not define her, she grew as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, signing several fashion contracts around the world. Nowadays, she uses her platform to&nbsp;empower others for their individuality, personality, and diversity.</p><p><h2>4. Kelly Knox, born without a&nbsp;left forearm</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/334/62e/bd6acc5405ae758a20325753cb.jpg><p>Whenever Kelly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Knox</a> walks down any catwalk, she inspires more than one person with her beauty. This British model became one of&nbsp;the first disabled models to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;Fashion Week. But her path to&nbsp;the catwalk was not easy, and it&nbsp;took her 11&nbsp;years of&nbsp;battling prejudice to&nbsp;be&nbsp;where she is&nbsp;now. She was born without her left forearm and decided not to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;prosthetic arm as&nbsp;an&nbsp;aid.</p><p>For models like Kelly Knox who have the courage to&nbsp;follow their dreams, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brands</a> like Tommy Hilfiger are changing the fashion game. Many brands are creating lines of&nbsp;adaptable clothing with one-hand zippers and magnetic buttons. This is&nbsp;increasing fashion designers’ commitment to&nbsp;diversity and inclusion.<br></p><p><h2>5. Ellie Goldstein, Down syndrome</h2></p><p>After being the face of&nbsp;Gucci <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Beauty</a> at&nbsp;just 18&nbsp;years old, Ellie Goldstein has caught the world’s attention. This British model was born with <a href=# title="Down syndrome" data-link=tag>Down syndrome</a> and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age, she decided that she wanted a&nbsp;modeling career. Ellie signed her first contract at&nbsp;age 15&nbsp;with an&nbsp;inclusive <a href=# title=talent data-link=tag>talent</a> agency.</p><p>Her unique personality and beauty have given her the opportunity to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;campaigns for big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brands</a> like Nike, Primark, and Laura Mercier. Her mother has supported Ellie all along and together, they are taking the fashion industry by&nbsp;storm.</p><p><h2>6. Viktoria Modesta, an&nbsp;amputated leg</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Viktoria</a> Modesta is&nbsp;synonymous with personality. She is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;model but an&nbsp;artist and creative director who is&nbsp;enthusiastic about futuristic art and <a href=# title=science data-link=tag>science</a>. Viktoria was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> with a&nbsp;limb malfunction and at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;20, she made the decision to&nbsp;amputate the lower part of&nbsp;her left leg. She defines herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bionic model and wears a&nbsp;prosthetic as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extension of&nbsp;her unique personality.</p><p>Viktoria wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell a&nbsp;bigger story about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>identity</a>. And that’s why she diversifies her talent in&nbsp;various artistic fields. Her fashion campaigns always make a&nbsp;statement and she is&nbsp;eager to&nbsp;revolutionize the industry not only because of&nbsp;her condition but because of&nbsp;her style.</p><p><h2>7. Winnie Harlow, Vitiligo</h2></p><p>This Jamaican-Canadian supermodel is&nbsp;taking the fashion world by&nbsp;storm. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Winnie</a> Harlow was born with <a href=# title=vitiligo data-link=tag>vitiligo</a> and at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;26, she worked alongside Victoria’s Secret and luxury brands, such as&nbsp;Fendi and Marc Jacobs. When she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>young</a>, she never really thought about a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;fashion, but after an&nbsp;interview with a&nbsp;Toronto photographer, Winnie was encouraged to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the industry.</p><p>She is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>focused</a> on&nbsp;being true and authentic. Winnie doesn’t define herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;role model, but instead, she keeps things real and wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;known for her talent.</p><p><h2>8. Moffy Gathorne, strabismus</h2></p><p>Her unique feature is&nbsp;what makes her distinguishable and a&nbsp;true icon in&nbsp;fashion. Moffy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gathorne</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;London-born model with strabismus, which causes her eyes to&nbsp;misalign. In&nbsp;2013, she made her debut as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;the POP magazine, and since then, she has been in&nbsp;the eye of&nbsp;fashion.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Moffy</a> is&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her lazy eye, and when she got the chance to&nbsp;have eye surgery, she declined it&nbsp;and decided to&nbsp;embrace her condition as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her personality. She defines beauty as&nbsp;self-realization, knowing who you are and what you can achieve.</p><p><h2>9. Melanie Gaydos, Marfan syndrome</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afa/242/78c9ae52efa1972c98e4d36670.jpg><p>Fashion stereotypes are being left behind, and Melanie Gaydos is&nbsp;making great steps toward beauty diversity. When she was born, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Melanie</a> was diagnosed with ectodermal dysplasia, a&nbsp;rare condition that occurs in&nbsp;1&nbsp;in&nbsp;every 10,000&nbsp;births. This condition causes the teeth, pores, cartilage, nails, and bones to&nbsp;not fully develop.</p><p>After undergoing 30-40&nbsp;surgeries, this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>model</a> hasn’t let her condition stop her. Being aware of&nbsp;her uniqueness, she decided to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;fashion, becoming a&nbsp;unique, versatile, and creative model. Over time, Melanie made her own path and has walked several times in&nbsp;New York Fashion Week shows.</p><p><h2>10. Carola Insolera, deaf</h2></p><p>Carola Insolera is&nbsp;known for being the only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deaf female</a> model currently active in&nbsp;the fashion industry. This Norwegian model was born deaf and comes from a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deaf </a>family. Before becoming a&nbsp;model, she worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV presenter, communicating in&nbsp;sign language. In&nbsp;addition, she worked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;circus as&nbsp;a&nbsp;trapeze artist, clown, and contortionist.</p><p>It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;2011 that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Carola</a> was asked to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;show at&nbsp;Copenhagen Fashion Week. Since then, she has dedicated her life to&nbsp;working exclusively in&nbsp;the fashion industry. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;communicating, she doesn’t use interpreters, instead, she uses a&nbsp;visual form of&nbsp;communication. Not letting her deafness keep her off the catwalk, Carola trusts her instincts and demonstrates her natural talent.</p><p><h2>11. Alexandra Kutas, a&nbsp;wheelchair model</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f4/beb/30d00e52e3bff55bf1d1ba434f.jpg><p>Alexandra Kutas is&nbsp;the first runway model in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wheelchair and the first Ukrainian model with a&nbsp;disability. During her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a>, she suffered a&nbsp;spinal cord injury. However, this has not held her back, as&nbsp;she made a&nbsp;name for herself in&nbsp;fashion and is&nbsp;an&nbsp;advocate for the rights of&nbsp;people with disabilities.</p><p>It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>16</a>&nbsp;that she decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;model, and after being inspired by&nbsp;the stories of&nbsp;various disabled women from around the world, she felt that it&nbsp;was her time to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;change in&nbsp;the fashion industry. She made her first appearance in&nbsp;Ukrainian Fashion Week and since then, she has participated in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>catwalks</a> on&nbsp;3&nbsp;different continents.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexandra</a> is&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;her voice and works for her community, encouraging companies to&nbsp;increase their services toward the inclusion of&nbsp;the disabled.</p><p>These women are a&nbsp;clear example that you can achieve anything as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you have the courage to&nbsp;go&nbsp;after&nbsp;it. Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;dream job or&nbsp;a&nbsp;goal that you are currently working on&nbsp;to&nbsp;make possible?
