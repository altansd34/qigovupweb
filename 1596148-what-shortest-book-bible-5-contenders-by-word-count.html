For instance, the Catholic Church canon has 73 books, Protestant denominations have 66 books, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon has 81 books. The books have varying lengths and volumes determined by number of words, verses, and chapters. So, what is the shortest book in the Bible?</p><h2 id=1596148-what-is-the-shortest-book-in-the-bible class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What is the shortest book in the Bible?</h2><p class=align-left>You have probably read several books of the Bible, but have you ever wondered which is the shortest? Knowing the shortest <a href=#>can</a> be challenging because you may have to consider the word count, verses, or chapters. It can further be complicated since the Bible has been translated into several languages, significantly altering the word count.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4df6c3bc045efca2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 baptism quotes and bible verses for the special day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, to determine the shortest book, the word count should be determined using the original languages of the Bible. The original language of the Old Testament is Hebrew, while the original language of the New Testament is Greek. Here are the five shortest books of the Bible based on the word count in their original language.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3 John</strong></p>This book was originally written in Greek and is the shortest in the Bible, at approximately 219 words. It is in the New Testament.<p class=align-left><strong>2 John</strong></p>This is the second-shortest among the Bible books. It was originally written in Greek and has approximately 245 words. It is a book of the New Testament.<p class=align-left><strong>Philemon</strong></p>Philemon comes third at approximately 335 words. This New Testament book was originally written in Greek.<p class=align-left><strong>Obadiah</strong></p>Obadiah is the fourth shortest book of the Bible. It is found in the Old Testament and was originally written in Hebrew. It has approximately 440 words.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b19c511b2d7d8298.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 iconic The Notebook quotes from the movie and novel</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Jude</strong></p>The Book of Jude is the fifth shortest, with an estimated word count of 461.

If you consider verses in determining the shortest book of the Bible, the arrangement per word count is different. Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that the book with the least words is the shortest regarding verses. Here are the five shortest Bible books by verses.</p><li><strong>2 John:</strong> It has 13 verses. It is an epistle dedicated to the elect lady and her children. It discusses the importance of truth and love and warns against false teaching.</li><li><strong>3 John:</strong> It has 15 verses. It is a personal letter from Apostle John to Gaius acknowledging and applauding his hospitality while warning against Diotrephes's adverse influences.</li><li><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It has 21 verses. It is one of the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and it discusses the judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.</li><li><strong>Philemon:</strong> It has 25 verses. This epistle from Paul to Philemon urges him to forgive and <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1136172-prayer-points-mercy-favour-god.html href=#>have mercy</a> on Onesimus, his brother in Christ and his runaway slave.</li><li><strong>Jude:</strong> It has 25 verses. The Book of Jude cautions against false teachers, encourages Christians to contend for the faith, and emphasises perseverance and holiness.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/465241931b1d7f05.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 weird Bible verses you have probably never heard of</span></p></a><h2 id=1596148-shortest-book-in-the-bible-by-chapters class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Shortest book in the Bible by chapters</h2><p class=align-left>While most books of the Bible have multiple chapters, only five have single chapters, making them the shortest books by chapters.

This book is quite different from other gospel books as it focuses on Jesus Christ's spiritual and theological aspects.</li><li><strong>Matthew:</strong> It is the third-shortest book of the gospel, with 28 chapters and about 18,345 words. The book portrays Jesus Christ as the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophesies. It has several teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount.</li><li><strong>Luke:</strong> It is the longest book of the gospel, with 24 chapters and approximately 19,482 words.
