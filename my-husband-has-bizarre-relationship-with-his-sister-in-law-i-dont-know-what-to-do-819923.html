But there’s a&nbsp;grain of&nbsp;salt that spoils their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> and has even brought it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the point when the desperate woman is&nbsp;thinking about a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. The woman wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and shared her story, and the thing that’s really disturbing her is&nbsp;her husband’s weird relationship with his SIL. Angela shared her concerns in&nbsp;her letter and asked our readers for a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice about her complicated and delicate situation.</p><p><h2>Angela and Alex have a&nbsp;wonderful relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/555/499/470a7155ba8e8216167339325f.jpg><p>Angela, 33, is&nbsp;our devoted reader, who wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and shared a&nbsp;story about her difficult <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> situation. The woman has no&nbsp;one to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;about a&nbsp;desperate situation she’s facing with her husband. She’s afraid that her friends and parents won’t understand her, so&nbsp;the woman decided to&nbsp;ask the opinions of&nbsp;people on&nbsp;the internet. Angela is&nbsp;looking for a&nbsp;good piece of&nbsp;advice from our readers, and here’s her story.</p><p>The woman wrote, “Hi&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>! My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been happy together for 8&nbsp;years. This is&nbsp;literally the best relationship I’ve ever been&nbsp;in. Alex is&nbsp;an&nbsp;ideal partner, and we&nbsp;never had any problems and arguments, except for his brother’s wife. Her name is&nbsp;Ashley and my&nbsp;husband’s brother, Sam, has recently got married to&nbsp;her for the second time.<br>Their relationship story is&nbsp;quite turbulent, as&nbsp;they divorced when Alex and&nbsp;I just got married. Nine years ago, Ashley cheated on&nbsp;Sam. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;forgive her, and they stayed together for almost a&nbsp;year after her infidelity, but even the family counselling didn’t help, and they ended up&nbsp;parting ways and going to&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact with each other.</p><p>I&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;meet Ashley before she and Sam split&nbsp;up. Recently, they met each other and felt this spark between them again, so&nbsp;Sam decided to&nbsp;give this relationship a&nbsp;second chance and he&nbsp;and Ashley remarried.<br>I&nbsp;first met her right before their second wedding. I&nbsp;totally wanted for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good friends, but things have been developing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;totally different way.”</p><p><h2>Angela has been seeing red flags in&nbsp;her husband’s SIL’s behavior from the start.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/540/544/ceafcd59cdb33824efc1326d93.jpg><p>Angela goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Literally, the first time&nbsp;I met Ashley, I&nbsp;instantly felt humiliated. She was wearing a&nbsp;very provocative dress. Alex and&nbsp;I were visiting them at&nbsp;their place, and she came out of&nbsp;the bathroom, half-dressed, specifically went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and casually asked him to&nbsp;zip her dress&nbsp;up.</p><p>I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was inappropriate, but we’d just met, so&nbsp;I didn’t make a&nbsp;fuss about&nbsp;it. Before I’d met Ashley, my&nbsp;husband once spoke about her as&nbsp;his ’relationship guru.’ He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;told her a&nbsp;lot about me&nbsp;and our perfect relationship.”</p><p><h2>Things have become even more unhealthy with time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa0/16a/43cbbb58869ec55e75aa196366.jpg><p>Angela continues her story, saying, “The relationship between Alex and Ashley has been very weird since that first meeting. Ashley regularly makes me&nbsp;uncomfortable.<br>She often pulls my&nbsp;husband away to&nbsp;talk one on&nbsp;one. She touches Alex regularly, and what is&nbsp;even more annoying is&nbsp;that they both have that small inside jokes, so&nbsp;I just sit there like a&nbsp;fool, because&nbsp;I don’t really get them. Ashley often makes silly voices to&nbsp;Alex and they both laugh, this woman just straight ignores&nbsp;me, though&nbsp;I always act super friendly towards her.</p><p>This situation is&nbsp;getting exhausting. One of&nbsp;the last times&nbsp;I saw her, she dared to&nbsp;complain that in ’good old times’ she and Alex were talking every day about different things and were literally best friends. She said they don’t talk as&nbsp;much now, because now Alex is&nbsp;married and ’has obligations’.”</p><p><h2>Angela’s husband doesn’t think that his real with his SIL&nbsp;is a&nbsp;problem.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8b/62a/c12a4c5628a367747f22cb2ec7.jpg><p>Angela wrote, “I&nbsp;confronted Alex about this awkward relationship many times. He&nbsp;keeps saying that I’m overthinking and that he’s just ’being friendly’ with his brother’s wife. He&nbsp;explained that he&nbsp;knows how much Sam loves Ashley, and he&nbsp;just wants to&nbsp;make sure that she smoothly fits into the family again. Alex says that by&nbsp;being extremely friendly, he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;show Ashley that he&nbsp;doesn’t blame her for breaking his brother’s heart in&nbsp;the past and that all her bad deeds are forgotten and forgiven.</p><p>When I&nbsp;asked Alex if&nbsp;he&nbsp;and Ashley had any special relationship in&nbsp;the past, he&nbsp;said that they weren’t friends and that Ashley was exaggerating when she told me&nbsp;that they used to&nbsp;talk a&nbsp;lot. He&nbsp;says that once she helped him get over some unfortunate relationship with some girl he&nbsp;dated, and she was his help and support in&nbsp;that situation, nothing more.</p><p>But I&nbsp;feel like everything is&nbsp;wrong between Alex and&nbsp;me, and, specifically, between him and Ashley. I&nbsp;even thought of&nbsp;it&nbsp;being an&nbsp;emotional infidelity, and now I’m considering taking a&nbsp;pause in&nbsp;my&nbsp;marriage. Sometimes I&nbsp;think about a&nbsp;divorce. What should I&nbsp;do?”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who broke a&nbsp;happy family and became a&nbsp;<a href=#>mistress</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;married man. The woman expected a&nbsp;paradise in&nbsp;her relationship with her beloved, but her life turned into a&nbsp;big nightmare.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6qa3SZpmispGnv6Z50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16qbXSZqqiq6Sav261zWajmq9dnnqlu82tZKSmn6x6uLTArWStp12ZvG6EkHJwa2tfdMCpu9aYmKWkj5i8rrnEp6us</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1443003-nell-verlaques-biography-age-height-birthday-parents-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nell Verlaques biography: age, height, Big Shot, parents, movies">&larr;
